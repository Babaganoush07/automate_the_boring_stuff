Project: Adding Bullets to Wiki Markup
When editing a Wikipedia article, you can create a bulleted list by putting 
each list item on its own line and placing a star in front. But say you have 
a really large list that you want to add bullet points to. You could just type 
those stars at the beginning of each line, one by one. Or you could automate this task with a short Python script.
The bulletPointAdder.py script will get the text from the clipboard, add 
a star and space to the beginning of each line, and then paste this new 
text to the clipboard. For example, if I copied the following text (for the 
Wikipedia article “List of Lists of Lists”) to the clipboard:

Lists of animals
Lists of aquarium life
Lists of biologists by author abbreviation
Lists of cultivars

and then ran the bulletPointAdder.py program, the clipboard would then contain the following:
* Lists of animals
* Lists of aquarium life
* Lists of biologists by author abbreviation
* Lists of cultivars
